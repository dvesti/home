# Resistor Rage!


Every resistor has a certain amount of ohms, ohms are the unit delegated to electrical resistance. A resistor with 220 ohms applied to a 5v current, will cut down the power significantly.

Instead of making things easy by just writing the amount of ohms on each of the resistors, in 1920 the Radio Manufacturers Association decided we needed a color code! ![](/img/2017/12/Resistor_Color_Code.jpg)
